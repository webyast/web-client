Firewall
========

User can turn the firewall on and off. He can also block/allow individual
services to pass through the firewall.

User is shown current status of firewall. If the firewall is running, it is 
shown as on (regardless of whether it will be enabled on reboot or not). 
User can change the setting by clicking the checkbox and pressing save. When
saving the off status, the firewall service is stopped and will not be started on
next boot. When saving the on status, the firewall service is started and will
also be started on next boot.

The user also sees 2 groups of service names - allowed and blocked. By clicking
on a service name, he can move the service from one group to the other and 
back. By clicking save the changes become effective.

If the user is about to block a needed service (webyast and webyast-ui) the 
user is presented with a warning message. This is done to prevent the user from
blocking his access to WebYaST itself.
