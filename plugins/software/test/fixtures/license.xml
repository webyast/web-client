      applications intended to run on the Java Platform Standard Edition
      (Java SE platform) platform on Java-enabled general purpose desktop
      computers and servers.

      &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement, as well as the restrictions and exceptions set forth in
      the Software README file, Sun grants you a non-exclusive,
      non-transferable, royalty-free limited license to reproduce and use
      the Software internally, complete and unmodified, for the sole
      purposes of running Programs and designing, developing and testing
      Programs.  Sun also grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
      royalty-free limited license to reproduce and distribute the
      Software, directly or indirectly through your licensees,
      distributors, resellers, or OEMs, electronically or in physical
      form or pre-installed with your Operating System on a general
      purpose desktop computer or server, provided that: (a) the Software
      and any proprietary legends or notices are complete and unmodified;
      (b) the Software is distributed with your Operating System, and
      such distribution is solely for the purposes of running Programs
      under the control of your Operating System and designing,
      developing and testing Programs to be run under the control of your
      Operating System; (c) you do not combine, configure or distribute
      the Software to run in conjunction with any additional software
      that implements the same or similar functionality or APIs as the
      Software; (d) you do not remove or modify any included license
      agreement or impede or prevent it from displaying and requiring
      acceptance; (e) you only distribute the Software subject to this
      license agreement; and (f) you agree to defend and indemnify Sun
      and its licensors from and against any damages, costs, liabilities,
      settlement amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys&amp;amp;#39; fees)
      incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any
      third party that arises or results from (i) the use or distribution
      of your Operating System, or any part thereof, in any manner, or
      (ii) your use or distribution of the Software in violation of the
      terms of this Agreement or applicable law.  You shall not be
      obligated under Section 2(f)(i) if such claim would not have
      occurred but for a modification made to your Operating System by
      someone not under your direction or control, and you were in
      compliance with all other terms of this Agreement.  If the Software
      README file permits certain files to be replaced or omitted from
      your distribution, then any such replacement(s) or omission(s)
shall not be considered a breach of Section 2(a).

&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;RESTRICTIONS.  Software is copyrighted and title to Software and
all associated intellectual property rights is retained by Sun
and/or its licensors.  Unless enforcement is prohibited by
applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse engineer
Software.  You may not create, modify, or change the behavior of,
  or authorize your licensees, distributors, resellers, OEMs, or end
  users (collectively, &amp;amp;quot;Licensees&amp;amp;quot;) to create, modify, or change the
  behavior of, classes, interfaces, or subpackages that are in any
  way identified as &amp;amp;quot;java&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;javax&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;sun&amp;amp;quot; or similar convention as
  specified by Sun in any naming convention designation. You
  acknowledge that Licensed Software is not designed or intended for
  use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any
  nuclear facility. Sun Microsystems, Inc. disclaims any express or
  implied warranty of fitness for such uses.


  &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;COMPATIBILITY.  If you exercise the license in Section 2, and Sun
  or a licensee of the Software (under section 4(b)) notifies you
  that there are compatibility issues (as determined by the
      applicable Technology Compatibility Kit) caused by the interaction
  of the Software with your Operating System, then within ninety
  (90) days you must either: (a) modify the Operating System in a
  way that resolves the compatibility issue (as determined by Sun)
and make a patch or replacement version available to your
Licensees who have already received the version of your Operating
System that was the subject of the compatibility issue (&amp;amp;quot;Your
    Incompatible Operating System&amp;amp;quot;); or (b) cease distributing the
Software and make commercially reasonable attempts to forward the
notification to your Licensees who have already received Your
Incompatible Operating System.

&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Trademarks and Logos. No right, title or interest in or to any
trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its
licensors is granted under this Agreement. You acknowledge and
agree that, as between you and Sun, Sun owns the SUN and JAVA
trademarks and all SUN and JAVA-related trademarks, service marks,
           logos and other brand designations (&amp;amp;quot;Sun Marks&amp;amp;quot;), and you agree to
           comply with the Sun Trademark and Logo Usage Requirements
           currently located at http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. Any
           use you make of the Sun Marks inures to Sun&amp;amp;#39;s benefit.

           &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;LIMITED WARRANTY.  If you received the Software directly from Sun
           or its authorized resellers, Sun warrants to you that for a period
           of ninety (90) days from delivery to you, the media on which
           Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in
           materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for the
           foregoing, Software is provided &amp;amp;quot;AS IS&amp;amp;quot;.  Your exclusive remedy
           and Sun&amp;amp;#39;s entire liability under this limited warranty will be
           replacement of the Software media.  This limited warranty gives
           you specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from
           state to state.


           &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL
           EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
           INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO
           THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

           &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE
           LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
           PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
           AGREEMENT (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA, OR OTHER ECONOMIC
               ADVANTAGE), NO MATTER WHAT THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF SUN HAS
           BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will
           Sun&amp;amp;#39;s liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
               negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for the
           Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will
           apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential
           purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or
           consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
           applicable to you.

           &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;THIRD PARTY CODE. Additional copyright notices and license terms
           applicable to portions of the Software are set forth in the
           THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt file. In addition to any terms and
           conditions of any third party opensource/freeware license
           identified in the THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt file, the disclaimer
           of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in paragraphs 7
           and 8 of this Agreement shall apply to all Software in this
           distribution.

           &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Termination.  This Agreement is effective until it is
           terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by
           ceasing distribution of the Software. This Agreement will
           terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to
           comply with any material provision herein.  Either party may
           terminate this Agreement immediately should any Software become,
           or in either party&amp;amp;#39;s opinion be likely to become, the subject of a
           claim of infringement of any intellectual property right.  Upon
           termination, you must destroy all copies and cease copying and
           distribution of the Software. All of your obligations and any
           applicable limitations on your rights and remedies under this
           Agreement shall survive termination.


           &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;SOURCE CODE.  Software may contain source code that, unless
           expressly licensed for other purposes, is provided solely for
           reference purposes pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
           Source code may not be redistributed unless expressly provided for
           in this Agreement.

           &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Export Regulations. All Software and technical data delivered
           under this Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may
           be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
           You acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain such
           licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after
           delivery to you.

           &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If Software is being acquired
           by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government
           prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
           Government&amp;amp;#39;s rights in Software and accompanying documentation
           will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance
           with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense
               (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
                 acquisitions).

               &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;MISCELLANEOUS.  Any action related to this Agreement will be
               governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No
               choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. If any
               provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
               Agreement will remain in effect upon the parties&amp;amp;#39; agreement to
               revised terms that most nearly accomplish the same effect. This
               Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to
               its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
               oral or written communications, proposals, representations and
               warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms
               of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication
               between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term
               of this Agreement.  No modification of this Agreement will be
               binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized
               representative of each party.

               &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;
