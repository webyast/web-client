This document is about the workflow when connecting to webclient.

'rake routes' on toplevel shows all the known routes, from there
you'll see:

 root  /  {:controller=>"main", :action=>"index"}

Main
----

MainController is just a redirector, either to Controlpanel (session
established) or to Session.new (no session).

Session
-------

Session.new checks for params[:hostname]. If none is found, the user
has to choose a host via Host.index first.

If a hostname is found, a login screen asks for username and password,
and calls Session.create


Host
----

This is a 'host chooser' redirecting to Session.new afterwards


Controlpanel
------------

This is the main 'landing' page, showing a quick status and offering
some recently used modules to navigate to.
