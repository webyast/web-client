Workflow / Routing of webclient
===============================

This document is about the workflow when connecting to webclient.

'rake routes' on toplevel shows all the known routes, from there
you'll see:

 root  /  {:controller=>"main", :action=>"index"}


MainController is just a redirector, either to Controlpanel (session
established) or to Session.new (no session).
