YaST-Webservice-Client
========================
After you have installed the package you can start the lighthttp with the
command line:

rcyastwebc start


You can connect to the local server which can be started with the command:

rcyastwebs start

(package yast2-webservice)


HTTPS Protocol
================

SSL
-----

Before we start configuring lighttpd for the YaST-webclient, we’ve got to get an SSL certificate. If you’re creating your own, 
you can follow the instructions from the lighttpd web site:

openssl req -new -x509 -keyout host.pem -out host.pem -days 365 -nodes

If you already have a certificate that’s a .crt and a .key file, you have to make them snuggle up into a single .pem file:

cat host.key host.crt > host.pem

Both of these methods result in a single .pem file, usually named ΄host.pem‘ where ΄host‘ is the name of the server you’re using 
the certificate for. This file can be stored anywhere you want on your system, since the lighttpd configuration takes an explicit path to it.
Normally certificates are stored in /etc/ssl/certs.

Configure lighttpd
--------------------

Add these two entries to /srv/www/yast/config/lighttpd.conf

ssl.engine         = "enable"
ssl.pemfile        = "/etc/ssl/certs/host.pem"

and restart the server with

rcyastwebc restart

Now you can login with HTTPS protocol.
