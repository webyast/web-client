Here are UI testing scripts using Selenium framework (http://seleniumhq.org)

Basic information:

1. run 'rake test:ui' to start UI tests
2. the tests have been generated from *.xml files by Selenium IDE
   (do not edit them directly, use Selenium IDE for changes and export the tests)

See http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Web/Development/UI_Testing for more information.
