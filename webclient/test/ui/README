Here are UI testing scripts using Selenium framework (http://seleniumhq.org)

Basic information:

1. run 'rake test:ui' to start UI tests (or 'rake test:ui TEST=ui/example_test.rb')
2. the tests have been generated from src/*.xml files by Selenium IDE
   (do not edit *.rb files directly, load *.xml file into Selenium IDE, change it and export the tests)

See http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Web/Development/UI_Testing for more information.
